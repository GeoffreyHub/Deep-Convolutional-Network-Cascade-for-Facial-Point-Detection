There are four dataset used in the project: LFPW, webface, CASIA_test and CelebA.
If classifying those more precise, there are six dataset: LFW_train, LFW_test, webface_train, webface_test, CASIA_test and CelebA.
It is worth saying that I do not use the testing dataset provided by the author because the bbox is wrong.

Training method 1:
1.LFW_train and webface_train (overall 10000 images) are the training dataset;
2.LFW_test and webface_test (overall 3466 images) are the validation dataset;
3.For example in 'F1.py', 'EN1.py' and 'NM1.py', I take training method 1, and it is the same method as the paper.

Training method 2:
1.CelebA (overall 202599 images) are the training dataset;
2.LFW_train, webface_train, LFW_test and webface_test (overall 13466 images) are the validation dataset;
3.I do not upload this program in Github.

Testing method:
1.Apply the well trained networks.
2.Take CASIA_test as the test dataset, and see the results. You can find the implementation in '*_run.py'

Attention! You should not apply this dataset to other applications!
This dataset is processed by 'zhaoyuzhi' and it's only for 'Deep-Convolutional-Network-Cascade-for-Facial-Point-Detection' repository.

If you want to download CelebA dataset, please visit their official website: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html
You shoule use these images of 'Img\\img_align_celeba' fold.
The normalization/preprocessing method is in 'read_CelebA_for_level1.py'.
